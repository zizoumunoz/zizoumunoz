# Hi, I'm Zinadine :)

I'm a university student working on becoming a game developer.

I specialize in C/C++, C#, and Java.

My top current active project is Station 93, a terminal style game inspired
on the tabletop RPG 'Traveller' and the original Rogue from 1980.

I also like making my own build scripts using powershell so I can get more
familiar with compiling/linking! If you want to build any of my C/C++ projects,
make sure you are in the Developer Console for VS instead of the normal one.
